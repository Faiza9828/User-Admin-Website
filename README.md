# User-Admin-Website
🚀 Project Upgrade Alert! 🚀  

I’m thrilled to share an extension to my previous project – a Hostel/Property Management Platform! 🎉  

This new addition takes the hostel-finding website I developed earlier to the next level by introducing an Admin Portal for property owners and admins. The platform now bridges the gap between property owners and users with an intuitive management system.

💻 Tech Stack:  
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Graphs & Analytics: Chart.js

🌟 Next Steps:  
The next phase involves deploying a full-stack solution with backend APIs and database integration to enable multi-user support and real-time data synchronization.  

This project is a step closer to building a comprehensive, scalable property management system.  

Would love to connect with other developers or product managers working on similar ideas! Let’s collaborate and innovate together. 🚀
